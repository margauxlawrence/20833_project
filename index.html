        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project examines the relationship between major global events and the types of songs people stream on Spotify, utilizing computational tools to understand how cultural moments influence collective listening habits. Building on the text-analysis workflow we developed earlier in the semester, this project combines quantitative coding methods with humanistic interpretation to examine whether listeners tend to gravitate toward specific musical qualities, such as energy, mood, and language, during times of celebration, crisis, or uncertainty. By connecting musical trends to real-world events, the study aims to understand how people use music not just as entertainment but as an emotional outlet that reflects the cultural atmosphere around them. 
          To investigate this, we focus on four significant events that span very different emotional contexts: the Barbenheimer release in July 2023, the onset of the Hamas–Israel conflict in October 2023, the Maui wildfires in August 2023, and the Eastern Australian floods in March 2022. These moments include both high-energy, upbeat cultural hype and sudden, distressing crises. By comparing streaming patterns surrounding these events, we aim to see whether shifts in mood, energy levels, and even language choice are detectable in the most-streamed global songs during each period. This project builds directly from our HW4-1, HW4-2, and HW5 work, but expands the scope by integrating term-frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and close reading. Together, these methods allow us to move from simple numerical observations to a more complex, human-centered interpretation of music and culture, capturing what happens when coding meets real emotional experiences in the world.

          <p>
            One of the biggest takeaways from this project was realizing how much stronger our interpretation became once we combined computational methods with traditional humanities thinking. On their own, the numbers in the Spotify dataset didn’t immediately reveal a clear story. Energy percentages, valence scores, and BPM values are just isolated metrics until you put them into a cultural context. But once we paired those metrics with the emotional atmosphere of each event, and then added layers like sentiment scores, term-frequency comparisons, and topic modeling of song titles, the patterns became more meaningful. Coding helped us see trends that we wouldn’t have noticed from close reading alone, especially in terms of shifts in mood and energy across different types of events. 
            At the same time, this project showed us the limitations of computational tools. For example, topic modeling generated clusters that needed real interpretation, especially because song titles are short and sometimes vague. The code could group similar words, but it couldn’t explain why listeners gravitated toward certain types of music during the Barbenheimer hype versus during more distressing moments like the Maui wildfires or the Hamas–Israel conflict. That part required human judgment, cultural awareness, and thoughtful analysis.
            Overall, this project helped me understand what “digital humanities” actually looks like in practice. It’s not about choosing between data or interpretation; it’s about blending both to form stronger, more grounded insights. If we had more time, I’d want to expand the dataset to include full lyrics or longer time windows, which could reveal even deeper patterns. But even within this scope, the combination of coding and cultural analysis led to insights we couldn’t have reached using just one approach alone.
